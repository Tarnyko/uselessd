1. Obtain source. If there is no configure file present,
   run either autogen.sh or `autoreconf -fvi` to generate
   it.

2. Run configure, view the help, enable and disable
   components as seen fit. Of particular importance
   are the following prefixes, which may vary between
   distros:

   --sysconfdir=
   --with-root-prefix=
   --with-sysvinit-path=
   --with-tty-gid=
   --with-telinit=
   --with-sysvrcnd-path=
   --with-kbd-setfont=
   --with-kbd-loadkeys=
   --with-rc-local-script-path-start=
   --with-rc-local-script-path-stop=

   sysconfdir is /etc, root prefix is typically left
   blank, sysvinit path is typically /etc/init.d/,
   GIDs can be discovered using `getent group
   <GROUPNAME>`, sysvrcnd-path may be /etc/rcS.d/,
   so on and so forth. These things should be easy
   to deduce.

3. make

4. Optionally run make check, to see if tests pass.
   Test failures don't necessarily mean uselessd won't
   work, but they are worth looking into. If
   test-sleep in particular happens to fail,
   try running systemd-machine-id-setup and retry.

5. make install

6. Now it's time to make your system boot from uselessd.
   In GRUB2, you will need to find the appropriate
   GRUB menu config (located in /etc/default/grub
   in some distros, or /etc/grub.d) and modify the
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT option to include the
   following line:

   init=/lib/systemd/uselessd

   You may also optionally add arguments, such as
   systemd.log_target and systemd.log_level to control
   where uselessd[1]'s logs are outputted, and their
   verbosity, respectively.

7. update-grub
   reboot

   Pray to dmr or something.

8. Permanent conversion to uselessd will vary from distro
   to distro, depending on exact init scheme implementation.
   Certain things like symlinking to /sbin/init are a given.
