SD_MESSAGE should be addressed.
dietlibc compatibility.
Improve FreeBSD port, port to other *BSDs and Hurd.
Fix up manpages and build.
Look for units to tweak.
Decouple stuff from PID1.
...

	Consider moving *-setup.c files to shared. ??? systemd-shutdown's
	files, as well.

	Make update-utmp configurable out of the build.

	Refactor core and shared files. Merge or decouple where needed.

	Look into isolating some of the resource control and execution
	logic into separate tools, alongside the context of declarative
	unit configuration guided by a transactional dependency system.
	Alternately, look into making a lighter port of systemd-run,
	or separating the functionality of systemctl set-property (as
	well as perhaps get-default and set-default [targets]) into
	a separate tool with extended options, so as to at least
	emulate the purpose of transient units.

	Write a tool or add configuration options (in system.conf
	and/or user.conf) to tweak the parameters of the transaction
	system.

	Remove i18n/NLS/.po entirely.

	REMINDER: Backport bugfixes from systemd-stable.
