uselessd System and Service Manager

Version 4 (2014-10-06)
----------------------
   *  systemd-analyze, -activate, -cgtop and -delta can now be
      configured out of the build.

   *  systemd-initctl is now only installed when the HAVE_SYSV_COMPAT
      conditional evaluates to true.

   *  The infamous /proc/cmdline "debug" argument fiasco has been
      addressed by renaming it to "systemd.debug", so that it uses
      an exclusive namespace. Currently, upstream systemd resolves
      the issue by keeping the generic term "debug", but simply
      redirecting output to journald as soon as it is available.
      As we do not have it, we implement this.

   *  Various bugfixes from systemd-stable have been backported, like
      basic.target and sysinit.target no longer having a
      RefuseManualStart option.

Version 3 (2014-09-30)
----------------------
   *  The systemd-machine-id-setup tool is now entirely standalone
      and not also a routine called by PID1. It is governed by a
      oneshot unit, and it can be optionally disabled from the build.

   *  Two new tools have been introduced:

      uselessd-hostname-setup
      uselessd-loopback-setup

      These are once again decoupled from PID1 logic and refactored
      into their own tools wrapped around by getopt loops, and
      governed by oneshot units. They, too, can be disabled from
      the build, and come with brief manpages.

      You may need to enable their services through systemctl.

   *  The test-hostname binary was dropped for being redundant,
      as a result. The test was manual to begin with.

   *  libgcrypt and liblzma (xz) have been dropped from the build,
      due to not actually being used. They formerly belonged as
      enabling optional extensions to journald behavior.

   *  An ordering bug in one of the default units was fixed.

   *  A bugfix for systemd-tmpfiles was backported, concerning files
      inheriting the age of their top-level directories.

Version 2 (2014-09-25)
----------------------
   *  Redundant options from systemd-analyze (set-log-level and dump)
      have been removed. Use the ones from the uselessd binary instead,
      or by setting the systemd.log_level kernel parameter.

   *  The internal pager has been removed entirely. Pipes exist for
      a reason. Use them. Don't burden the software with junk.

   *  A double-free bug has been fixed in the can_sleep() function in
      sleep-config.c. This means that the test-sleep binary will now
      pass successfully.

   *  Some memory leaks were patched, thanks to findings obtained from
      clang-analyzer.

   *  An unused shared file was removed, as well as some vestiges from
      the old manpages. Unused dropin directories were removed from
      systemd-delta's array listing.

   *  The flag for disabling static linking has been removed from the
      build. Nonetheless, a modern GNU/Linux system typically requires
      shared objects for components such as NSS, gethostname(2) and many
      other things. We haven't done anything to explicitly enable static
      builds, we just got rid of the build-time error.
