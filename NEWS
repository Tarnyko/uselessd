uselessd System and Service Manager

Version 2 (2014-09-25)
----------------------
   *  Redundant options from systemd-analyze (set-log-level and dump)
      have been removed. Use the ones from the uselessd binary instead,
      or by setting the systemd.log_level kernel parameter.

   *  The internal pager has been removed entirely. Pipes exist for
      a reason. Use them. Don't burden the software with junk.

   *  A double-free bug has been fixed in the can_sleep() function in
      sleep-config.c. This means that the test-sleep binary will now
      pass successfully.

   *  Some memory leaks were patched, thanks to findings obtained from
      clang-analyzer.

   *  An unused shared file was removed, as well as some vestiges from
      the old manpages. Unused dropin directories were removed from
      systemd-delta's array listing.

   *  The flag for disabling static linking has been removed from the
      build. Nonetheless, a modern GNU/Linux system typically requires
      shared objects for components such as NSS, gethostname(2) and many
      other things. We haven't done anything to explicitly enable static
      builds, we just got rid of the build-time error.
